NLP models for board game 3D printed product descriptions

## Abstract
This repository provides natural language processing models specialized to analize text of 3D printed product
descriptions about board games.

## Rationale
The models were created to satisfy data analysis needs in a startup project related to 3D printing, specifically about
board game product descriptions in spanish. Although the problem domain is very specific and the incentives very
personal, the project intends to scale these models to handle more languages, but focused in the domain already defined.
